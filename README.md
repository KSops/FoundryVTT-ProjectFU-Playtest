# ProjectFU Playtest Support

This module aims to add support for classes and features that were present in playtest documents to the [ProjectFU](https://github.com/League-of-Fabulous-Developers/FoundryVTT-Fabula-Ultima) system for FoundryVTT.
As a secondary goal, it is also intended as a showcase for how developers can integrate with the core ProjectFU system.

Our plan is to promote classes and features into the core system, once the books they appear in are available internationally.

## Currently supported:

### Esper
* Psychic Gift class feature

### Mutant
* Therioform class feature
* Associated Therioforms section for the NPC sheet

### Pilot
* Vehicle class feature
* Armor, Weapon and Support Modules
* Vehicle section for the Character sheet

### Natural Fantasy classes
* coming soon
